## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy joblib
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdoTarek2211/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
```

2. Install required dependencies:
