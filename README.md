# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict heart disease based on various demographic and health-related factors using machine learning algorithms.

## Introduction

Heart disease is a prevalent health issue worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on demographic and health-related features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is "Heart_Disease.csv", which contains information about individuals including Chest pain type, BP, FBS over 120, EKG results, Max HR, Exercise angina, ST depression, Slope of ST, Number of vessels fluro, Thallium, age, gender, cholesterol levels, work type, smoking status, and whether they have heart disease or not.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Installation

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
